# Task Management System

This project was developed in **Java** to practice software design, data handling, and object-oriented programming concepts.  
It is a **console-based task management system** that allows users to create, list, update, and delete tasks efficiently.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to simulate a simple yet functional **task management application**, similar to a to-do list.  
The user can manage daily tasks directly through the terminal — adding new ones, marking them as completed, or removing them when done.

This project demonstrates how Java can be used to build practical and structured applications using core programming principles.
